## Projects
_Below are some of my most successfull creations within the main projects of the first term. As well as my presentations and workings attached in links and images._ 

### Eye Bombing

- For my Eye Bombing project I focused on visually capturing proximity and continuation within a home, using the buildings structures and fittings. As well as house hold objects and items in their natural positioning to produce relevant imagery.

### Union hack
- View Union hack presentation [Here.](https://spark.adobe.com/page/KfdQhfHs1zvN2/)

- For my Union hack project I decided to focus on the Australian Flag as I believe it is in need of some update. Being from australia I felt quite passionate about try to create a flag of what I felt represented Australia to me and to what I percieve others would feel.

### Code in your plate

- My recipe in Thimble[Here.](https://thimbleprojects.org/jakesathimble/140346/)

- For my Code in your plate project I used salmon and rice as my recipe which I created on markdown and in thimble to improve the design layout to make it more accessable for the user. Below are screen shots of my work on Thimble of HTML and CSS coding of the recipe remixed.
